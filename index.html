<h1>Why Aristotle and Saint Thomas Aquinas?</h1>
<img src="images/Retrato de un caballero joven.jpg" alt="Portrait">
<p> Many have the impression that the philosophical project started by the pagan Aristotle and completed by Saint Thomas Aquinas 
in the bosom of the Catholic Church has been superseded by the exciting scientific and technological progress of the past two centuries.
Where immense amounts of time were spent defining and manipulating terms and propositions, seemingly to no end, progress in science
seemed to grasp the fundamentals of reality by applying them in dramatically improving man's material conditions and showing him previously unthinkable wonders.
Speculation on the nature of reality gave way to thoughts focused on accelerating scientific and industrial progress — not primarily because of the failure of the
old system, but because of the exhiliration associated with the new.

This website aims to provide a complete english-language course in Aristotelian-Thomistic philosophy. Accurate english-language resources on Aristotelian-Thomistic philosophy are quite rare.
Those that exist are very liable to be influenced by modern (Cartesian or Humean) assumptions about philosophy that Aristotle and St. Thomas either explcitly repudiate or find absurd.
Aristotelian-Thomistic philosophy is a philosophy of <i> certainty</i>. It is certain because it claims that man can know reality through his senses, as well as reason from his senses to conclusions he can be certain of. 
This is in contrast to modern philosophers of every persuasion, which either deny that the senses can know reality or the efficacy of reason.
I have seen many friends of mine who, although they have likely never touched a work of these modern philosophers, who are so scared of making any certain pronouncement on any topic, that they end every idea with the words <q> I don't know</q>.

<h1>What is this course based on?</h1>
<p>
The whole of this course is based on a Spanish translation of Regis Jolivet's work "Traite de Philosophie", which is an excellent and very clear course.
The Logic sections are supplemented with "Socratic Logic" by Peter Kreeft, which is an excellent textbook in English, thought it misses a few things that
Jolivet says.
